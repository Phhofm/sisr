# Datasets

A collection of dataset links that I think might be useful for sisr training dataset preparation/curation.  
Note from me as a model trainer: Please make sure, if you create your own curated versions or mixup curated versions of these datasets, to only include the training images. Do not include val or testing parts of these datasets.  
Reason is simple: I (or others) create val sets out of these val or test parts. Models trained on these images will naturally perform better and such a usage will diminish the actualy usefulness or fairness of testing models against those val sets.
